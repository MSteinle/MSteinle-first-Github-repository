for FreeCodeCamp projects
My goal is to complete the FreeCodeCamp projects in order to refresh and/or rebuild my skills and then obtain employment in the web building industry.  During my hiatus from the software world I continued to dabble in web deisgn and building, but really need to ramp it up for employability.
